        <li>First, thoroughly clean, then wash and boil the cow foot on medium to high  heat.  Add enough water to boil, then add the whole onion if you’re using any. Add the Knorr cubes and salt to taste. Boil till very soft, then discard the onion. To save time, you can use a pressure cooker for this.

        </li>
        <li>Add the stock fish into a medium size pot, add one Knorr cube and salt to taste and boil till tender. Alternatively, you can just chuck them into a microwaveable bowl, add water to cover and heat on high heat till tender. When it’s tender, shred into bite size chunks and set aside….
