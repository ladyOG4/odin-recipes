    <h1>MoiMoi</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/moii.jpeg" height="240" width="240">
    <p>Moi moi (beans pudding) is one of such Nigerian foods that are loved by every Nigerian. I make moi-moi from beans and some other local ingredients.

    </p>
    <p> It is a protein-rich Yoruba food that is commonly eaten across West Africa.</p>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A mixture of washed and peeled beans</li>
        <li>onions</li>
        <li>fresh red pepper</li>
        <li>spices</li>
        <li>fish/boiled eggs</li>
        <li>crayfish</li>
        <li>shombo</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>PREPARATIONS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Split the red tatashe or shombo into two halves to remove the seeds at the center, this practice is necessary because the seeds add a bitter taste to moi moi. Wash and also pluck off the green stem at the top.

        </li>
        <li>Parboil the fresh /frozen fish, pick out from the water then pieces the fish with your fingers, not really squashing (leave in bits).

        </li>
        <li>What I do at this point is to add all of them (beans, onions, crayfish and tatashe or shobo) in a small clean bowl and blend till smooth texture</li>
        <li>Pour in the oil into the ground beans,half-cup (125ml), add 2 seasoning cubes, the fish water (fish stock) (which must not be over a half cup) salt to taste. Stir and taste the entire mixture.

        </li>
        <li>I can drop the egg on top after I have distributed the barter in cooking plates.

        </li>
        <li>Distribute in as many plates as possible, some people use wrappers for this purpose. After the distribution, you can drop into the cooking pot.

        </li>
        <li>Add water simultaneously making sure it doesnâ€™t top the first plate.

            Then cover tightly and cook for about 40 to 60 minutes adding water at interval to avoid burning or too much water that would run into the plates.
            
            </li>
            <li>And its ready!!!
                 Nigerian (beans pudding) can also be served alone, I love it.

            </li>
    </ol>
